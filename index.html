<h1>Chapter 1, The Beggining.</h1>
<p>Gabby is a unique, odd character.
 She is nice and sweat, if you buy her food,
 otherwise, she is just nice. From Time to time sh ecan be bossy 
but in all honesty I'm dramatic sooooooo depends on 
who you ask really. She works as a mentor, a coach almost.
She helps student in highschool, for example . . . me,
 she helps with homework, keeping my grades in check,
even buys you food, if she will ever agree to my bets. 
sometimes im lazy, I dont want to do anything and yet there she is
"Do some work" she would say, then I say "NAWWWWWW I dont want to".
ot goes on likr this for a while until she MAKES me do work.
All in all shes a good haerted person, cares alot
and has good taste in anime, books, food
lots of things, but not everyone is perfect, she can be bossy
or mean by forcing you to do work, or not buying you fod, 
but all in all she is a good person.</p>
